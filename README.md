> Apollo is a browser-based tool for visualisation and editing of sequence
> annotations. It is designed for distributed community annotation efforts,
> where numerous people may be working on the same sequences in geographically
> different locations; real-time updating keeps all users in sync during the
> editing process.

## Running the Container

The container is publicly available as `gmod/apollo:stable`. The recommended
method for launching the container is via docker-compose due to a dependency on
a postgres image.

There are a large number of environment variables that can be adjusted to suit
your site's needs. These can be seen in the
[apollo-config.groovy](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/master/sample-docker-apollo-config.groovy)
file.

## Quickstart

This procedure starts tomcat in a standard virtualized environment with a PostgreSQL database.

- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for your system if not previously done.
- `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 erasche/apollo:unified`
- Apollo will be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
